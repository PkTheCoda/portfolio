              That's right, you don't need to pay at all until you see the website. So how does this benefit us? Well, you don't need to worry about
              paying for something that you don't like, and if you choose to not pay, I have another stellar portfolio site! It's really a win-win.
              Of course, if you don't pay, you don't get the site. But trust me, when you see the site, the last thing on your mind is not paying ðŸ˜‰
